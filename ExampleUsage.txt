%Anywhere in document - puts the body in a theorem env
\begin{restatethis}{theorem}{aLabelForMyImportantTheorem}
  Here's a very important theorem I want to state this.
\end{restatethis}
%Anywhere else to create a verbatim copy within a theorem env (with same number)
%Unlike restatable this command can come before the restatethis env
\restate{aLabelForMyImportantTheorem}
%Perhaps only the body of the text is wanted
\begin{lemma}
  \restateBody{aLabelForMyImportantTheorem}
  %now the body text of Important Theorem is in a lemma
\end{lemma}
%The label also works with hyperref
I am referencing \autoref{aLabelForMyImportantTheorem}.

%Maybe you want to make a super minor change between the copies
%That is the purpose of \restateAlt
\begin{restatethis}{lemma}{lemma1}
  Lots going on here. 
  \restateAlt{aLabeltoTriggerThisOpt}%
  {This is the default text that will appear in the restatethis env%
  and anywhere without aLabeltoTriggerThisOpt enabled}%
  {This will be appear when aLabeltoTriggerThisOpt is enabled}
  \restateAlt{opt2}{You can have more than 1!}{More than 1 is possible}
\end{restatethis}
%Somewhere else - both alternatives appear
\restate[aLabeltoTriggerThisOpt,opt2]{lemma1}
%Somewhere else - the default for aLabeltoTriggerThisOpt is used, but "More than 1 is possible" is used.
\restateBody[opt2]{lemma1}
%or no alternatives at all
\restate{lemma1}
%Labels for the options should be unique across all restatethis -es
